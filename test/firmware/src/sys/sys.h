/**
 * @file sys.h
 * @brief Highest level include for system libraries.
 *
 * This file acts as a proxy for specific subsystem include headers. Project 
 * firmware could include this file instead of the subsystem specific 
 * headers, or it could include only the needed subsystem headers.
 * 
 * As such, this file should not have any major functional code elements. 
 * Various definitions needed for configuring the lower level modules 
 * should be placed in and used from `bsp/board.h` and `bsp/uc_pum.h` and 
 * it's include chain.
 * 
 * In general, the subsystem libraries should be thought of as a translation
 * layer between application code, the underlying hardware drivers, and any
 * external libraries the subsystem depends on. In cases where a subsystem 
 * depends on external libraries, this layer along with the HAL should provide 
 * enough hooks to port the usage of library to other applications and 
 * platforms. 
 * 
 * As of now, the subsystem layer handles :
 *      
 *   - Translation of subsystem functions into HAL functions, and the 
 *     associated routing of interfaces. Switching a subsystem from one 
 *     interface to another is implemented here.
 *   - Providing port-specific handlers for external library based 
 *     subsystems. All functions the library expects to see in the 
 *     application with hardware-specific implementations are defined
 *     here and reroute to the correct interface's HAL.
