/**
 * @file uuid.h
 * @brief Public include header for the UUID generation library.
 * 
 * WARNING : This is completely untested following the migration to 
 *           platformIO, pending a proxmial use case for it or free 
 *           time and a debugger handy. While it compiles, expect 
 *           this to not be working at this time. 
 * 
 * This library provides UUID generation functions, to generate UUIDs 
 * compliant with RFC4122.
 * 
 *  - Version 1 : Date-time and MAC address
 *  - Version 2 : DCE security                 (no support planned)
 *  - Version 3 : MD5 Hash and Namespace
 *  - Version 4 : Random           
 *  - Version 5 : SHA1 Hash and Namespace
 *  - Version 6 : Non-standard variant
 * 
 * Note that the bulk of this library is NOT re-entrant. It is the 
 * application's responsibility to ensure that a uuid generation function 
 * is not called while a previous one is still in process.
 * 
 * @see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>
 * @see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122>
 * 
 * Support for versions 1 and 6
 * ----------------------------
 * 
 * Date-time is utilized from the EBS time library, which must be included in 
 * the application. 
 * 
 * @note If you intend to use version 1 or 6 UUIDs, you should ensure that 
 * the time library is initialized, the systick timer is installed and started, 
 * and time is synchronized to real time - either from an RTC or by the Host 
 * before the v1 UUID is generated. This library does nothing to make sure 
 * that the used system time makes any kind of sense. 
 * 
 * @warning While the EBS time library allows for some flexibility of the 
 * epoch, this library assumes system time is provided against the UNIX epoch, 
 * and offsets are hard coded accordingly. Similarly, the TIME_TICKS_PER_SECOND 
 * preprocessor definiton of the time library provides the applicable 
 * conversion factor which cannot be changed at link time or run time.
 * 
 * @see <https://github.com/chintal/ebs-lib-time>
 * 
 * Clock sequence is simply generated randomly using the rand_byte() function,
 * which should be available at link time. For better compliance with RFC4122, 
 * the clock sequence should be written to some form of non-volatile storage. 
 * Such an implementation is left to the application.
 * 
 * The 'node' or 'MAC address' used is platfom (and application) dependent. 
 * This implementation will simply use the first 6 bytes of whatever unique 
 * identifier is available on the platform via the uC HAL's id interface.
 * Ideally, the node should be constructed using a hash of the entire 
 * identifier, but that is not done here to keep code relatively small. This
 * may be changed in the future if v1 or v6 UUIDs are used often. 
 * 
 * UUID version 6 is a non-standard variant of the version 1 UUID which allows for 
 * chronological sorting when treated as an arbitrary string of bytes.
 * 
 * @see <https://bradleypeabody.github.io/uuidv6/>
 * 
 * Support for versions 3 and 5
 * ----------------------------
 * 
 * For version 3 and 5 UUID generation, the namespace should be a UUID in of 
 * itself, and can either be generated using one of the functions here or 
 * pre-installed into a UUID type variable. MD5 and SHA1 hashes are generated 
 * using the EBS repackaged version of AVR Crypto Lib. Note that due to the 
 * dependency on cryptolib, which is in turn a derivative AVR Crypto Lib, this 
 * library is necessarily licensed under the GPLv3 without any linking 
 * exceptions. Applications using this library must also, consequently, be 
 * distributed under the terms of the GPLv3 license.
 * 
 * @note The v5 implementation may be switched to SHA256 instead of SHA1 in 
 * the future. since SHA256 is more likely to be used in the application 
 * otherwise, including as part of the PRNG (entropium). This will make the
 * implementation less compliant with the letter of the RFC4122.
 * 
 * @see <https://github.com/chintal/cryptolib>
 * 
 * Support for version 4
 * ---------------------
 * 
 * Random (v4) UUID generation in this library depends on the presense of a 
 * rand_byte() function at link time. In order to be fully compliant with 
 * the UUID spec, the preferable random generator would be the entropium 
 * CSPRNG. Some of the simpler PRBS generators may be fine for less demanding 
 * applications.
 * 
 * @note This library does not attempt to initialize the random number 
 * generator. The application should ensure it is correctly configured and 
 * initialized before UUID v4 is generated.
 *
 * @see <https://github.com/chintal/ebs-lib-prbs>
 * @see <https://github.com/chintal/cryptolib>
 * 
 * Note on version 2
 * -----------------
 * 
 * DCE Security (v2) UUID does not seem to have immediate applications in 
 * constrained embedded systems. If there is an application that calls for it, 
 * support may be added to this library based on the context of the example 
 * application. The DCE/CDE spec for v2 UUIDs by itself seems exceptionally 
 * dense.
 * 
 * @see <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629399/apdxa.htm>
